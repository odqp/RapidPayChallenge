# RapidPayChallenge
Notes:
This solution is using EF InMemory database.


To improve the Authorization accoding extra requirements, were added two end points:
"UsersAuth/register/"
"UsersAuth/login/"


To test the application, 
1.-Use UsersAuth/register/ endpoint to create a user, 
2.-Use UsersAuth/login/ endpoint to get the Token.
3.-Use this token using the Bearer scheme.
